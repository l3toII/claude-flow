# Design Principles

Guidelines for distinctive, high-quality UI.

## Anti-Slop Rules

### NEVER Use
- Generic fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial
- Purple gradients on white
- Symmetric, predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter components
- Stock patterns

### ALWAYS Apply
- Distinctive typography
- Bold color choices
- Asymmetric layouts
- Purposeful animations
- Texture and depth

## Typography

| Mood | Fonts |
|------|-------|
| Modern/Tech | Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono |
| Luxury | Playfair Display, Cormorant |
| Friendly | Nunito, Quicksand |
| Bold | Bebas Neue, Oswald |

## Color Strategy

```
Primary:    Strong, not muted
Secondary:  Complementary
Accent:     Bold, attention-grabbing
Background: Off-whites, subtle tints
Text:       #1a1a1a (not pure black)
```

## Layout Principles

1. Break the grid intentionally
2. Overlap elements for depth
3. Vary rhythm
4. White space as design element
5. Visual hierarchy through size

## Animation

- Enter: 200-300ms, subtle
- Hover: 100ms, immediate
- Transitions: smooth, purposeful
- Loading: engaging, not annoying
